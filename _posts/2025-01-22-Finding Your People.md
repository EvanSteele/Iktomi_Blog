summary: Holding on to what matters in the years ahead
---
Right now we're living in a time of unprecedented turmoil. Wealth inequality is at its highest, and those at the very top have completed what they've been wanting for decades: control over government, control over media, and insulation from the public to avoid direct action against them. 

The American people have lost this battle. We are likely to lose more as we continue to fight. We are likely to see our allies overseas struggle and lose their own battles, as they depended on a unified America to provide them with support. There will be a large amount of suffering in the coming years and decades, because this doesn't end with the next presidential term. The work required to undo the damage done this week will potentially take the rest of our lives. This is our burden for failing to act when the first signs appeared, for allowing the Bystander Effect to have more sway on our actions than our moral compass.

Frustration is expected right now. Feeling upset is normal, feeling powerless is expected. The only feeling that we can not accept is complacency. The desire to tune out, play a game, watch old movies, and hope someone else has a better plan to fix this. 

No one has a plan for this. If they did we wouldn't be here. We need to make that plan, and We includes You. 

We start by finding our people. We make a community. Not an online community, a real, flesh-and-blood, in-person community. Proximity matters. A law restricting your autonomy will make your online community change their profile picture for you. That same law will make your in-person community riot for you.

The community doesn't need to be political, in fact it's probably better if it isn't. Political communities are an echo chamber, all members chasing that same unreachable ideal from different angles. They have a place, join them if you believe in that ideal, but also have a community focused on a more personal goal. That might be picking up trash, or improving some skill, or just looking for a place to play boardgames and drink for a bit. The end goal of the community isn't as important as the people that make it. 

Find your group, find multiple if you can manage it. Attend every meeting and find a way to not just participate, but contribute. From your contributions you'll see the group grow. Groth brings influence, influence brings change. This is how we change the world, not through some online global struggle, but small skirmishes and battles to make your community a better place.
