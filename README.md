# Iktomi blog

Iktomi is a scanning and enumeration project that's somewhat stalled out. Something I want to pick back up later on, but not my current priority. Since I already own the domain, I figued I can use it to host a blog until it's needed for something else. 

This Github page is technically the backend of the blog, if you want to see the actual site click [here](https://blog.iktomi.io)

## Setup

This is a Jekyll blog being hosted through Github Pages. Every time a push is submitted it automatically rebuilds the blog, adding new posts and content as needed. 

Actual writing is handled through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a Markdown based notetaking tool. In theory these two should compliment eachother, but it's something I'll need to play with and see what issues come up. One nice thing is that this should let me research, draft, format, and publish my posts all through the same app. Templating plugins can also be used to pre-fill all the needed frontmatter that will go onto posts as well.
