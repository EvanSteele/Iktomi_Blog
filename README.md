# Iktomi blog

Iktomi is a scanning and enumeration project that's somewhat stalled out. Something I want to pick back up later on, but not my current priority. Since I already own the domain, I figued I can use it to host a blog until it's needed for something else. 

## Setup

This is a Jekyll blog being hosted through Github Pages. Every time a push is submitted it automatically rebuilds the blog, adding new posts and content as needed.
