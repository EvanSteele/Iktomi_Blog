# About page

This poorly designed blog is designed by Evan Steele, and exists as more of a pet project than a functional site. It's made using flask and Github, and automatically rebuilds itself whenever I make a new commit to the repo. The idea for this was to try and find a way to create project writeups in [Obsidian](Obsidian.md) and have them get published automatically. We'll see if it works out in the end.
